## 5. SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE

### 5.1 HIGH-LEVEL ARCHITECTURE

#### 5.1.1 System Overview

The Node.js Hello World service follows a simple monolithic architecture pattern, appropriate for its minimal requirements. The system employs:

- **Single-Process Architecture**: A standalone Node.js process handles all HTTP requests without distribution across multiple services.
- **Request-Response Pattern**: The system follows a synchronous request-response pattern for handling HTTP interactions.
- **Core Module Utilization**: The architecture leverages Node.js built-in HTTP module to minimize dependencies.

Key architectural principles include:

- **Simplicity**: Minimizing complexity by using only essential components
- **Statelessness**: No session or state management between requests
- **Self-Containment**: No external dependencies beyond Node.js core modules

System boundaries are clearly defined with a single HTTP interface exposed to clients. The system does not integrate with external services, databases, or other components.

#### 5.1.2 Core Components Table

| Component Name | Primary Responsibility | Key Dependencies | Critical Considerations |
|----------------|------------------------|------------------|-------------------------|
| HTTP Server | Listen for incoming connections and manage server lifecycle | Node.js HTTP module | Port configuration, error handling during startup |
| Request Router | Direct incoming requests to appropriate handlers based on URL path | HTTP Server | URL path parsing, method validation |
| Hello Endpoint Handler | Process requests to `/hello` path and generate responses | Request Router | Response formatting, status code selection |
| Error Handler | Manage error conditions and generate appropriate error responses | All components | Consistent error formatting, proper HTTP status codes |

#### 5.1.3 Data Flow Description

The data flow in this system is straightforward and unidirectional:

1. HTTP clients send requests to the Node.js server on the configured port
2. The HTTP Server component receives and parses the raw HTTP request
3. The Request Router examines the URL path and HTTP method to determine the appropriate handler
4. For `/hello` path requests, the Hello Endpoint Handler processes the request
5. The handler generates a response containing "Hello world" text with appropriate headers
6. The HTTP Server sends the response back to the client

No data persistence occurs within the system. All processing happens in-memory without data transformation or storage requirements. The system maintains no state between requests, operating in a purely stateless manner.

#### 5.1.4 External Integration Points

| System Name | Integration Type | Data Exchange Pattern | Protocol/Format |
|-------------|------------------|------------------------|-----------------|
| HTTP Clients | Inbound | Request-Response | HTTP/Plain Text |

### 5.2 COMPONENT DETAILS

#### 5.2.1 HTTP Server Component

- **Purpose**: Initializes and manages the HTTP server, listening for incoming connections on a configured port
- **Responsibilities**:
  - Server lifecycle management (startup, shutdown)
  - Connection acceptance and request parsing
  - Response transmission
  - Error handling for server-level issues
- **Technologies**: Node.js HTTP module
- **Key Interfaces**:
  - `createServer()`: Creates HTTP server instance
  - `listen()`: Binds server to specified port
  - `close()`: Gracefully shuts down server
- **Scaling Considerations**: Single-instance design appropriate for demonstration purposes

#### 5.2.2 Request Router Component

- **Purpose**: Routes incoming HTTP requests to appropriate handlers based on URL path
- **Responsibilities**:
  - URL path parsing and validation
  - HTTP method validation
  - Handler dispatch based on routing rules
  - 404 handling for undefined routes
- **Technologies**: Node.js URL module, custom routing logic
- **Key Interfaces**:
  - Request handler function receiving (req, res) parameters
- **Scaling Considerations**: Simple path-based routing sufficient for single endpoint

#### 5.2.3 Hello Endpoint Handler

- **Purpose**: Processes requests to the `/hello` endpoint and generates responses
- **Responsibilities**:
  - Validates request method (GET supported)
  - Generates "Hello world" response text
  - Sets appropriate HTTP headers
  - Returns response to client
- **Technologies**: Node.js HTTP response methods
- **Key Interfaces**:
  - Handler function receiving (req, res) parameters
- **Scaling Considerations**: Stateless design supports horizontal scaling if needed

#### 5.2.4 Error Handler Component

- **Purpose**: Manages error conditions and generates appropriate error responses
- **Responsibilities**:
  - Captures and logs errors
  - Formats error responses with appropriate status codes
  - Prevents server crashes from unhandled exceptions
- **Technologies**: Node.js error handling patterns
- **Key Interfaces**:
  - Error handling middleware or functions
- **Scaling Considerations**: Centralized error handling simplifies maintenance

    subgraph "ADR-001: HTTP Server Implementation"
        A[Context: Need HTTP server implementation] --> B{Decision Point}
        B -->|Selected| C[Use Node.js HTTP core module]
        B -->|Rejected| D[Use Express.js framework]
        B -->|Rejected| E[Use Koa.js framework]

        D --> G[Consequences: Additional dependency, simplified routing]
        E --> H[Consequences: Modern middleware, additional complexity]
    end
```

### 5.4 CROSS-CUTTING CONCERNS

#### 5.4.1 Monitoring and Observability

For this minimal application, monitoring is limited to basic console logging:

- Server startup and shutdown events
- Incoming request details (method, path)
- Response status codes and timing
- Error conditions with stack traces

More sophisticated monitoring could be added for production use but is not required for the demonstration purpose.

#### 5.4.2 Logging Strategy

| Startup Logs | Console output | Record server initialization and configuration |
| Request Logs | Console output | Track incoming requests with method and path |
| Error Logs | Console error | Capture and report error conditions |
| Shutdown Logs | Console output | Record graceful shutdown process |

#### 5.4.3 Error Handling Patterns

The system implements a simple but effective error handling approach:

- **Route-level errors**: 404 for unknown paths, 405 for unsupported methods
- **Server-level errors**: Graceful handling of startup failures (e.g., port conflicts)
- **Runtime exceptions**: Try-catch blocks to prevent server crashes

```

#### 5.4.5 Performance Requirements

| Metric | Requirement | Implementation Approach |
|--------|-------------|-------------------------|
| Response Time | < 100ms | Minimal processing logic ensures fast responses |
| Throughput | Support multiple concurrent requests | Node.js event loop handles concurrent connections efficiently |
| Startup Time | < 1 second | No initialization dependencies or complex setup |
| Resource Usage | Minimal memory footprint | No in-memory caching or state management |

### 6.3 COMPONENT DESIGN DETAILS

#### 6.3.1 HTTP Server Component Design

The HTTP Server component serves as the entry point for the application, managing the HTTP server lifecycle and initial request handling.

**Key Design Elements:**
- Uses Node.js built-in `http` module to create server instance
- Configurable port with environment variable override and default fallback
- Graceful shutdown handling for SIGINT and SIGTERM signals
- Basic error handling for server startup issues

**Initialization Flow:**

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    Start([Server Start]) --> A[Import required modules]
    A --> B[Define request handler function]
    B --> C[Create HTTP server instance]
    C --> D[Define port configuration]
    D --> E[Start listening on port]
    E --> F{Server started?}
    F -->|Yes| G[Log successful startup]
    F -->|No| H[Log startup error]
    G --> I[Register shutdown handlers]
    H --> J[Exit process with error]
    I --> End([Server Running])
    J --> End2([Process Terminated])
```

#### 6.3.2 Request Router Component Design

The Request Router component analyzes incoming requests and directs them to the appropriate handler based on the URL path.

**Key Design Elements:**
- Simple path-based routing without complex pattern matching
- Support for HTTP method validation
- Direct mapping of paths to handler functions
- Default handler for unmatched routes (404)

**Routing Logic:**

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    Start([Request Received]) --> A[Parse URL path]
    A --> B{Path equals /hello?}
    B -->|Yes| C{Method is GET?}
    B -->|No| D[Invoke Not Found handler]
    C -->|Yes| E[Invoke Hello handler]
    C -->|No| F[Invoke Method Not Allowed handler]
    D --> End([Response Generated])
    E --> End
    F --> End
```

#### 6.3.3 Hello Endpoint Handler Design

The Hello Endpoint Handler processes requests to the `/hello` path and generates the "Hello world" response.

**Key Design Elements:**
- Validates HTTP method (supports GET only)
- Sets appropriate content type header
- Generates plain text response with "Hello world" message
- Returns 200 OK status for successful requests

**Handler Logic:**

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    Start([Hello Request]) --> A{Method is GET?}
    A -->|Yes| B[Set status code 200]
    A -->|No| C[Set status code 405]
    B --> D[Set content-type: text/plain]
    C --> E[Set content-type: text/plain]
    D --> F["Set body: 'Hello world'"]
    E --> G["Set body: 'Method Not Allowed'"]
    F --> H[End response]
    G --> H
    H --> End([Response Complete])
```

#### 6.3.4 Error Handler Component Design

The Error Handler component manages error conditions and generates appropriate error responses.

**Key Design Elements:**
- Centralized error handling logic
- Consistent error response format
- Appropriate HTTP status codes for different error types
- Error logging for debugging and monitoring

**Error Handling Logic:**

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    Start([Error Detected]) --> A{Error type?}
    A -->|Not Found| B[Set status code 404]
    A -->|Method Not Allowed| C[Set status code 405]
    A -->|Server Error| D[Set status code 500]
    B --> E[Set content-type header]
    C --> E
    D --> E
    E --> F[Set appropriate error message]
    F --> G[Log error details]
    G --> H[End response with error]
    H --> End([Error Response Sent])
```

### 6.4 INTERFACE SPECIFICATIONS

#### 6.4.1 HTTP API Specification

| Endpoint | Method | Description | Request Parameters | Response Format | Status Codes |
|----------|--------|-------------|-------------------|-----------------|--------------|
| `/hello` | GET | Returns "Hello world" text | None | Plain text | 200 OK, 405 Method Not Allowed |
| Any other path | Any | Returns not found error | None | Plain text | 404 Not Found |

**Request Example:**
```
GET /hello HTTP/1.1
Host: localhost:3000
```

**Success Response Example:**
```
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: text/plain
Content-Length: 11

Hello world
```

**Error Response Example:**
```
HTTP/1.1 404 Not Found
Content-Type: text/plain
Content-Length: 9

Not Found
```

#### 6.4.2 Internal Component Interfaces

| Interface | Signature | Description | Parameters | Return Value |
|-----------|-----------|-------------|------------|--------------|
| HTTP Server Request Listener | `(req, res) => void` | Main request handler function | req: HTTP request object<br>res: HTTP response object | None (side effect: response sent) |
| Request Router | `routeRequest(req, res)` | Routes requests to handlers | req: HTTP request object<br>res: HTTP response object | None (side effect: response sent) |
| Hello Handler | `handleHello(req, res)` | Processes /hello requests | req: HTTP request object<br>res: HTTP response object | None (side effect: response sent) |
| Error Handler | `handleError(err, req, res)` | Processes error conditions | err: Error object<br>req: HTTP request object<br>res: HTTP response object | None (side effect: response sent) |

### 6.5 COMPONENT STATE MANAGEMENT

#### 6.5.1 State Management Approach

The application follows a stateless design pattern, with no persistent state maintained between requests. This approach:

- Simplifies the implementation
- Eliminates concurrency concerns
- Supports horizontal scaling if needed
- Reduces memory usage

#### 6.5.2 Server Lifecycle States

```mermaid
stateDiagram-v2
    [*] --> Initializing
    Initializing --> Running: Server started
    Initializing --> Failed: Error during startup
    Running --> ShuttingDown: SIGINT/SIGTERM received
    ShuttingDown --> [*]: Server closed
    Failed --> [*]: Process terminated
```

#### 6.5.3 Request Processing States

```mermaid
stateDiagram-v2
    [*] --> Receiving
    Receiving --> Routing: Request received
    Routing --> Processing: Route matched
    Routing --> Erroring: Route not found
    Processing --> Responding: Processing complete
    Processing --> Erroring: Processing error
    Erroring --> Responding: Error response prepared
    Responding --> [*]: Response sent
```

### 6.6 COMPONENT CONFIGURATION

#### 6.6.1 Configuration Parameters

| Parameter | Description | Default Value | Source | Validation Rules |
|-----------|-------------|---------------|--------|------------------|
| PORT | HTTP server listening port | 3000 | Environment variable | Integer between 1-65535 |
| NODE_ENV | Runtime environment | 'development' | Environment variable | String: 'development', 'production', 'test' |

#### 6.6.2 Configuration Loading Process

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    Start([Configuration Loading]) --> A[Load environment variables]
    A --> B[Set PORT from environment or default]
    B --> C[Validate PORT value]
    C --> D{PORT valid?}
    D -->|Yes| E[Apply configuration]
    D -->|No| F[Log validation error]
    F --> G[Use default PORT value]
    G --> E
    E --> End([Configuration Complete])
```

### 6.7 ERROR HANDLING STRATEGY

#### 6.7.1 Error Categories

| Error Category | Description | Handling Approach | Response Code |
|----------------|-------------|-------------------|---------------|
| Route Not Found | Request to undefined endpoint | Return standard 404 response | 404 Not Found |
| Method Not Allowed | Unsupported HTTP method | Return standard 405 response | 405 Method Not Allowed |
| Server Error | Unexpected runtime error | Log error and return generic error response | 500 Internal Server Error |
| Startup Error | Error during server initialization | Log error and terminate process | N/A (process exit) |

#### 6.7.2 Error Response Format

All error responses follow a consistent plain text format:

```
HTTP/1.1 {STATUS_CODE} {STATUS_TEXT}
Content-Type: text/plain
Content-Length: {LENGTH}

{ERROR_MESSAGE}
```

#### 6.7.3 Error Logging Strategy

| Error Type | Log Level | Information Included | Destination |
|------------|-----------|----------------------|-------------|
| Route Not Found | Info | Request method, path, timestamp | Console |
| Method Not Allowed | Warning | Request method, path, timestamp | Console |
| Server Error | Error | Error message, stack trace, request details | Console |
| Startup Error | Fatal | Error message, stack trace | Console |

## 6.1 CORE SERVICES ARCHITECTURE

For this Node.js Hello World application, a traditional microservices or distributed architecture is not applicable. The system is intentionally designed as a simple monolithic application to demonstrate fundamental HTTP server concepts with minimal complexity.

### 6.1.1 ARCHITECTURE JUSTIFICATION

| Consideration | Rationale |
|---------------|-----------|
| System Complexity | The application has a single responsibility (serving "Hello world") that doesn't warrant service decomposition |
| Development Overhead | Microservices introduce unnecessary complexity for this educational example |
| Operational Simplicity | A monolithic design allows for easier deployment and maintenance |
| Resource Efficiency | A single process is more resource-efficient for this minimal functionality |

While distributed architectures provide benefits for complex systems, they introduce overhead that would be counterproductive for this simple application. The system can be fully described as a single-service monolith with the following characteristics:

### 6.1.2 SIMPLIFIED SERVICE ARCHITECTURE

```mermaid
graph TD
    Client[HTTP Client] -->|HTTP Request| NodeServer[Node.js HTTP Server]
    NodeServer -->|Process Request| Handler[Hello Endpoint Handler]
    Handler -->|Generate Response| NodeServer
    NodeServer -->|HTTP Response| Client
```

### 6.1.3 SCALABILITY CONSIDERATIONS

Although the application doesn't require a distributed architecture, basic scalability can still be addressed:

| Scaling Approach | Implementation |
|------------------|----------------|
| Horizontal Scaling | Multiple instances behind a load balancer if needed |
| Process Management | PM2 or similar tool for process monitoring and restart |
| Resource Optimization | Minimal memory footprint with efficient request handling |

```mermaid
graph TD
    Client[HTTP Clients] -->|Requests| LB[Load Balancer]
    LB -->|Route Request| Instance1[Node.js Instance 1]
    LB -->|Route Request| Instance2[Node.js Instance 2]
    LB -->|Route Request| InstanceN[Node.js Instance N]
```

### 6.1.4 RESILIENCE APPROACH

For this simple application, resilience is addressed through basic mechanisms:

| Resilience Aspect | Implementation |
|-------------------|----------------|
| Process Recovery | Automatic restart on crash (via process manager) |
| Error Handling | Proper exception handling to prevent crashes |
| Graceful Shutdown | Signal handling for clean termination |

```mermaid
stateDiagram-v2
    [*] --> Running
    Running --> Failed: Uncaught Exception
    Failed --> Restarting: Process Manager Detects
    Restarting --> Running: Restart Complete
    Running --> ShuttingDown: SIGTERM/SIGINT
    ShuttingDown --> [*]: Clean Termination
```

### 6.1.5 FUTURE ARCHITECTURE EVOLUTION

If the application were to grow in complexity, a more sophisticated architecture could be considered:

| Evolution Stage | Architectural Changes |
|-----------------|----------------------|
| Basic Scaling | Multiple instances with load balancing |
| API Gateway | Add routing layer for multiple endpoints |
| Service Decomposition | Split functionality into microservices when justified |
| Containerization | Docker deployment for consistent environments |

The current monolithic design provides a foundation that can evolve as requirements grow, without introducing premature architectural complexity.

### 6.2 DATABASE DESIGN

Database design is not applicable to this system. The Node.js Hello World application with a single `/hello` endpoint that returns "Hello world" does not require any persistent data storage for the following reasons:

#### Justification for No Database Requirement

| Reason | Explanation |
|--------|-------------|
| Stateless Operation | The application operates in a completely stateless manner, with no need to persist data between requests |
| Static Response | The endpoint returns a fixed "Hello world" string that doesn't depend on stored data |
| No User Data | The system doesn't collect, process, or store any user information |
| No Configuration Storage | All configuration is handled through environment variables or defaults in code |

#### Alternative Approaches for Future Extensions

If the application were to be extended in the future, the following data storage approaches could be considered:

| Extension Scenario | Potential Storage Solution |
|--------------------|-----------------------------|
| User Authentication | Add a database to store user credentials and session information |
| Request Logging | Implement a database or log storage service to track API usage |
| Dynamic Content | Introduce a database to store content that would replace the static "Hello world" message |
| Configuration Management | Add a database or configuration service for dynamic configuration |

#### Data Flow in Current Implementation

```mermaid
graph TD
    Client[HTTP Client] -->|HTTP Request| Server[Node.js Server]
    Server -->|Process Request| Memory[In-Memory Processing]
    Memory -->|Generate Static Response| Server
    Server -->|HTTP Response Hello world| Client
    
    classDef noStorage fill:#f9f,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px;
    class Memory noStorage;
```

The diagram illustrates that all processing occurs in-memory without any persistent storage components. The application maintains no state between requests and requires no database to fulfill its function of returning a static "Hello world" response.

Should the requirements change to include data persistence needs, this section would need to be revisited to design an appropriate database architecture.

### 6.3 INTEGRATION ARCHITECTURE

Integration Architecture is not applicable for this system in its current form. The Node.js Hello World application is designed as a standalone service with minimal functionality that does not require integration with external systems or services.

#### Justification for No Integration Requirements

| Reason | Explanation |
|--------|-------------|
| Self-Contained Functionality | The application's sole purpose is to return "Hello world" from a single endpoint, requiring no external data or services |
| No External Dependencies | The implementation uses only Node.js core modules without third-party services or APIs |
| Simplified Educational Purpose | The project serves as a minimal example of HTTP server implementation without the complexity of integration patterns |
| No Authentication Requirements | The endpoint is designed to be publicly accessible without authentication or authorization |

#### System Boundary Diagram

```mermaid
graph TD
    Client[HTTP Client] -->|HTTP Request to /hello| NodeServer[Node.js HTTP Server]
    NodeServer -->|"Hello world" Response| Client
    
    subgraph System Boundary
        NodeServer
    end
```

The diagram illustrates that the system operates entirely within its own boundary, with the only external interaction being the HTTP request/response cycle with clients.

#### Potential Future Integration Points

While the current implementation doesn't require integration architecture, the following table outlines potential integration points if the application were to be extended:

| Integration Type | Potential Implementation | Purpose |
|------------------|--------------------------|---------|
| API Gateway | Add API gateway in front of service | Request routing, rate limiting, and security if more endpoints are added |
| Monitoring Integration | Add Prometheus metrics endpoint | System health and performance monitoring |
| Logging Service | Add structured logging to external service | Centralized log collection and analysis |

#### Simplified HTTP Interface Specification

For completeness, the current HTTP interface is documented below:

| Aspect | Specification |
|--------|---------------|
| Protocol | HTTP/HTTPS |
| Endpoint | `/hello` |
| Method | GET |
| Response Format | Plain text |
| Status Codes | 200 OK, 404 Not Found, 405 Method Not Allowed |

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Client as HTTP Client
    participant Server as Node.js Server
    
    Client->>Server: HTTP GET /hello
    Server-->>Client: 200 OK "Hello world"
    
    Client->>Server: HTTP GET /unknown
    Server-->>Client: 404 Not Found
    
    Client->>Server: HTTP POST /hello
    Server-->>Client: 405 Method Not Allowed
```

Should the requirements evolve to include integration with external systems, this section would need to be expanded to include comprehensive API design, message processing patterns, and external system integration specifications.

### 6.4 SECURITY ARCHITECTURE

Detailed Security Architecture is not applicable for this system due to its minimal scope and educational purpose. The Node.js Hello World application with a single `/hello` endpoint returning static text does not require complex security controls, authentication mechanisms, or authorization frameworks.

#### 6.4.1 SECURITY APPROACH JUSTIFICATION

| Consideration | Rationale |
|---------------|-----------|
| Public Access | The `/hello` endpoint is designed to be publicly accessible without authentication |
| No Sensitive Data | The application does not process, store, or transmit any sensitive information |
| Educational Purpose | The primary goal is to demonstrate basic HTTP server functionality with minimal complexity |
| No User Management | The application does not have user accounts or personalized content |

#### 6.4.2 STANDARD SECURITY PRACTICES

While a comprehensive security architecture is not required, the following standard security practices will be implemented:

| Security Practice | Implementation Approach |
|-------------------|-------------------------|
| Input Validation | Validate HTTP method (GET only for `/hello` endpoint) |
| Error Handling | Return appropriate status codes without exposing system details |
| HTTP Headers | Set basic security headers for responses |
| Resource Limitations | Implement basic rate limiting if needed |

#### 6.4.3 SECURITY CONSIDERATIONS DIAGRAM

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    Client[HTTP Client] -->|Request| A{Valid Method?}
    A -->|Yes| B[Process Request]
    A -->|No| C[Return 405 Method Not Allowed]
    B --> D[Generate Response]
    C --> D
    D -->|Set Security Headers| E[Return Response]
    E --> Client
```

#### 6.4.4 RECOMMENDED SECURITY HEADERS

| Header | Value | Purpose |
|--------|-------|---------|
| X-Content-Type-Options | nosniff | Prevents MIME type sniffing |
| X-Frame-Options | DENY | Prevents clickjacking attacks |
| Content-Security-Policy | default-src 'none' | Restricts resource loading |
| Cache-Control | no-store | Prevents response caching |

#### 6.4.5 DEPLOYMENT SECURITY RECOMMENDATIONS

Although not part of the application code itself, the following deployment security practices are recommended:

| Area | Recommendation |
|------|----------------|
| Server Hardening | Run with minimal privileges |
| Network Security | Consider placing behind reverse proxy |
| Updates | Keep Node.js runtime updated |
| Monitoring | Implement basic request logging |

#### 6.4.6 SECURITY ZONES DIAGRAM

```mermaid
graph TD
    subgraph Internet
        Client[HTTP Client]
    end
    
    subgraph Application Environment
        Server[Node.js Server]
        Endpoint["/hello Endpoint"]
    end
    
    Client -->|HTTP Request| Server
    Server -->|Route Request| Endpoint
    Endpoint -->|Generate Response| Server
    Server -->|HTTP Response| Client
```

This simplified security architecture focuses on implementing appropriate security controls for the application's minimal requirements while maintaining its educational value and simplicity. As the application is expanded with additional features, the security architecture should be revisited and enhanced accordingly.

### 6.5 MONITORING AND OBSERVABILITY

#### 6.5.1 MONITORING APPROACH

Detailed Monitoring Architecture is not applicable for this system due to its minimal scope and educational purpose. The Node.js Hello World application with a single `/hello` endpoint returning static text does not require complex monitoring infrastructure, distributed tracing, or sophisticated alerting mechanisms.

However, basic monitoring practices will be implemented to ensure proper operation and provide educational value regarding fundamental observability concepts.

#### 6.5.2 BASIC MONITORING PRACTICES

| Practice | Implementation | Purpose |
|----------|----------------|---------|
| Console Logging | Standard output/error logging | Track server startup, requests, and errors |
| Health Endpoint | Optional `/health` endpoint | Allow basic availability monitoring |
| Process Monitoring | Basic process metrics | Track memory usage and CPU utilization |
| Request Logging | HTTP request/response logging | Monitor traffic patterns and response times |

#### 6.5.3 CONSOLE LOGGING STRATEGY

| Log Type | Information Included | Log Level |
|----------|----------------------|-----------|
| Startup | Server port, startup time | INFO |
| Request | Method, path, status code, response time | INFO |
| Error | Error message, stack trace, request context | ERROR |
| Shutdown | Shutdown reason, uptime | INFO |

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    A[Application Event] -->|Categorize| B{Event Type}
    B -->|Startup| C[Log Startup Info]
    B -->|Request| D[Log Request Details]
    B -->|Error| E[Log Error with Context]
    B -->|Shutdown| F[Log Shutdown Info]
    C --> G[Console Output]
    D --> G
    E --> G
    F --> G
```

#### 6.5.4 OPTIONAL HEALTH CHECK IMPLEMENTATION

```mermaid

    Client[Monitoring Client] -->|GET /health| Server[Node.js Server]
    Server -->|Check Status| Health[Health Check Logic]
    Health -->|Generate Response| Server
    Server -->|200 OK or Error Status| Client
```

| Health Check Component | Status Check |
|------------------------|--------------|
| Server Uptime | Duration since startup |
| Memory Usage | Current/max memory utilization |
| Request Count | Total requests processed |
| Error Count | Total errors encountered |

#### 6.5.5 SIMPLE METRICS COLLECTION

For educational purposes, the following basic metrics could be tracked:

| Metric | Description | Collection Method |
|--------|-------------|-------------------|
| Request Rate | Requests per minute | Count in memory |
| Response Time | Average response time in ms | Timing in request handler |
| Error Rate | Percentage of requests with errors | Count in error handler |
| Memory Usage | Process memory consumption | Node.js process.memoryUsage() |

#### 6.5.6 RECOMMENDED MONITORING EXTENSIONS

For production use or learning more advanced monitoring concepts, the following extensions could be considered:

| Extension | Purpose | Implementation Complexity |
|-----------|---------|----------------------------|
| Prometheus Integration | Metrics exposure for collection | Low |
| Structured Logging | Machine-parseable log format | Low |
| Status Dashboard | Visual monitoring interface | Medium |
| Synthetic Checks | Automated endpoint testing | Low |

#### 6.5.9 INCIDENT RESPONSE GUIDELINES

For educational purposes, a simplified incident response process can be documented:

| Incident Type | Detection Method | Response Action |
|---------------|------------------|-----------------|
| Server Down | Health check failure | Restart server process |
| High Error Rate | Error log monitoring | Check logs for error patterns |
| Performance Degradation | Response time increase | Check system resources |

This simplified monitoring and observability approach focuses on implementing appropriate practices for the application's minimal requirements while maintaining its educational value and simplicity. As the application is expanded with additional features, the monitoring architecture should be revisited and enhanced accordingly.

## 6.6 TESTING STRATEGY

### 6.6.1 TESTING APPROACH

While a comprehensive testing strategy is not required for this minimal Node.js Hello World application, implementing basic testing practices provides educational value and demonstrates proper software development practices. The testing approach will focus primarily on unit testing with limited integration testing to verify the core functionality.

#### Unit Testing

| Aspect | Implementation |
|--------|----------------|
| Testing Framework | Jest or Mocha with Chai |
| Test Organization | Tests organized by component (server, router, handlers) |
| Test Location | `/test/unit` directory with files matching `*.test.js` pattern |
| Mocking Strategy | Node.js `http` module mocking for isolated component testing |

**Test Structure Example:**

```mermaid
graph TD
    Root[test/] --> Unit[unit/]
    Root --> Integration[integration/]
    Unit --> ServerTest[server.test.js]
    Unit --> RouterTest[router.test.js]
    Unit --> HandlerTest[hello-handler.test.js]
    Integration --> APITest[api.test.js]
```

**Unit Test Naming Conventions:**

| Pattern | Example | Purpose |
|---------|---------|---------|
| `describe('Component')` | `describe('Hello Handler')` | Group tests for a component |
| `describe('method()')` | `describe('handleRequest()')` | Group tests for a method |
| `it('should behavior')` | `it('should return Hello world')` | Describe expected behavior |

**Code Coverage Requirements:**

| Component | Coverage Target | Critical Paths |
|-----------|-----------------|---------------|
| Hello Handler | 100% | Request handling, response generation |
| Request Router | 90%+ | Path matching, handler dispatch |
| HTTP Server | 80%+ | Server initialization, error handling |

#### Integration Testing

| Aspect | Implementation |
|--------|----------------|
| Testing Approach | HTTP requests to running server |
| Test Tool | Supertest or Axios with test framework |
| Test Scenarios | Valid requests, invalid paths, invalid methods |
| Test Location | `/test/integration` directory |

**Integration Test Scenarios:**

| Scenario | Expected Outcome | Validation |
|----------|------------------|------------|
| GET /hello | 200 OK with "Hello world" | Response body and status |
| GET /invalid | 404 Not Found | Status code verification |
| POST /hello | 405 Method Not Allowed | Status code verification |

### 6.6.2 TEST AUTOMATION

For this simple application, a lightweight test automation approach is appropriate:

| Aspect | Implementation |
|--------|----------------|
| Test Runner | npm test script |
| CI Integration | Basic GitHub Actions or similar CI workflow |
| Test Execution | Sequential execution (parallel not needed) |
| Test Reporting | Console output with optional HTML report |

**Test Execution Flow:**

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    Start([Start Test Run]) --> A[Install Dependencies]
    A --> B[Run Linter]
    B --> C[Run Unit Tests]
    C --> D[Start Test Server]
    D --> E[Run Integration Tests]
    E --> F[Generate Coverage Report]
    F --> G{All Tests Pass?}
    G -->|Yes| Success([Success])
    G -->|No| Failure([Failure])
    F --> H[Stop Test Server]
    H --> G
```

**CI/CD Integration:**

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    subgraph Developer
        A[Local Tests]
    end
    
    subgraph CI/CD Pipeline
        B[Checkout Code]
        C[Install Dependencies]
        D[Run Tests]
        E[Build Package]
        F[Deploy if Needed]
    end
    
    A -->|Push| B
    B --> C
    C --> D
    D -->|Success| E
    E --> F
    D -->|Failure| G[Notify Failure]
```
